It’s our pleasure to announce that a seminar on “Hassan Nasir's Life Work and Values” will be conducted (In Sha Allah) by Mr. 
Abdul Sattar Agha on this coming Monday (14 December, 2015/LH3/2:00PM-5:00PM). 
Hassan Nasir was a grassroots social justice activist from the early days of Pakistan. 
Despite coming from a very privileged background, he identified with the struggle for justice of peasants and industrial workers and 
helped them to organise for effective resistance against exploitation by feudal lords and unscrupulous industrialists.
 His defiant struggle for dignity for the common Pakistani mirrors the betrayal by the ruling class of the ideals that inspired the creation of Pakistan.
 
The speaker, Mr. Abdul Sattar Agha, 
is a seasoned journalist based in Islamabad, currently working as the Pakistan correspondent of National Public Radio (the US equivalent of the BBC). 
Previously he has worked at Dawn Karachi as sub-editor, at The News Karachi as sub-editor, at The News on Sunday, and as political reporter, 
Karachi at Dawn News' English channel.
 
He is a devoted student of World History, an astute observer of International Relations and has a deep understanding of Pakistani and Indian politics. 
The Marxist perspective on society is an essential part of his analysis of social and political relations and inspires his vision of a society based
 on socio-economic justice that liberates human beings from material want to attain higher levels of self-actualisation and contentment.

Hope to see you all

P.S. Registration will start at 1:45PM at the registration desk (outside LH3).
